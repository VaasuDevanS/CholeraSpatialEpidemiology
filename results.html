      <h3> 1. MOBILE SPATIAL EPIDEMIOLOGY DATA CAPTURE </h3>
      Mobile Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers such as phones can be used to generate real time public health data. 
      The user testing analysis of the ESRI collector based on built-in functions showed its potential in spatial and attributes 
      capture for 2017 – 2018 cholera outbreaks in Karonga district. Spatial data dimension analysis, shows that ESRI collector 
      can capture coordinates up to the average minimum accuracy of 3.3m. The collector demonstrates its capability in mapping 
      waypoints for 2017 -2018 cholera case in Karonga district (Figure 1).

      The configuration process indicated its attractive features such as collect a new feature icon, measure distance and area functions, 
      search bar, bookmarks and others. The configuration process shows that the file geodatabase for ESRI collector built in ArcMap 10.6 
      can be created using different domain name with the description extension. The domain name can be set in different properties by 
      choosing appropriate field type such as text, short integer, long integer, float, double and date. The geodatabase for ESRI collector 
      can also be set with unique coded values. The configuration process demonstrates that after creating all required attribute domains, 
      feature classes can be added to the geodatabase. The application demonstrated its online and offline field data acquisition and online 
      data syncing into ArcGIS geo-server. The configuration process of ESRI collector allows photo-tagged data capture and data syncing. 
      Field observations show that texts for the collector were readable, can be in upper or lower case and allows scrolling of text, 
      numeric and date option. The application works with an authority permitted by ESRI through ArcGIS online organization account. 
      Cholera cases for 2017 – 2018 were collected by ESRI collector using mulanje1 account for UNICEF Malawi. Field observations show that 
      collector application is user friendly with easy to understand, operate and navigate. It is reliable application with easy to remember 
      its organization link, speed download, data sync function and its measuring efficiency. The collector allows for data update such as editing. 
      Figure 1 shows the application’s configuration process, spatial data capture capability and mapped waypoints.

      <h3> 2. SPATIAL RISK FACTORS DEPENDENCY WITH DISTRIBUTION PATTERN OF CHOLERA CASES </h3>
      <h5> 2.1. Distribution of Cholera Cases </h5>
      The spatial distribution of 2017-2018 cholera outbreak, shows that the outbreak hits mostly the eastern part of the district. 
      The linear distribution pattern that follows the surface water of Lake Malawi, Songwe river, Lufira river, North Rukuru river and Wovwe 
      river. Figure 1 shows the spatial distribution of 2017-2018 cholera cases. <br><br>
      <div style="text-align: center">

      </div>

      <br>
      <h5> 2.2. Spatial dependency of cholera incidence and elevation </h5>
      Figure 2 shows the results of Moran’s I calculation and its statistical significance for cholera prevalence in association with 
      elevation. The spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I) statistical analysis shows a positive and statistically significant spatial 
      autocorrelation for dissimulative incidence rate of cholera cases from lower elevation interval to high elevation interval 
      (Moran's Index = 0.714228, p-value = 0.000000). The p-value shows a strong clustering pattern of cholera incidence and change of 
      elevation which clustering of high rates of cholera cases at the low lands part of Karonga district.
      <br> <br>
      <div style="text-align: center">

          Figure 2: Spatial Auto-correlation for cholera incidence and Elevation
      </div>
      <br>
      Given the z-score of 10.3803954895, there is a less than 1% likelihood that this clustered pattern could be the result of 
      random chance. The spatial relationship based of the counts of cholera cases within defined elevation interval was plotted. 
      The relationship shows that high cholera cases were registered in low lands with elevation less than 300m altitude and low cholera 
      cases in high lands with elevation interval of 601m – 900m altitude. Figure 3 shows the relationship between change of elevation 
      and rates of cholera cases.

      </div>

      <br>
      <h5> 2.3. Proximity analysis of cholera cases from surface water </h5>
      Evaluating the clustering of cholera cases homes for fixed distance buffer in reference to surface water sources was typically 
      implemented using count statistics for numeric fields. The proximity analysis based on distance of patients homes to the surface 
      water shows that the majority (count: 90) of cholera cases are within &lt; 0.5km buffer. Of 129 spatially collected 
      cholera cases, 42, 37, 14, 13 cholera cases and within 0.5 – 1km, 1.1 – 1.5km, 1.6 – 2km and 2.1 – 2.5km buffer respectively. 
      The proximity analysis based of fixed distance buffer shows that as the offsite distance increases from the surface water, the 
      number of cholera cases decrease. However, the proximity analysis validates spatial auto-correlation which shows an offsite decrease 
      of cholera cases from the surface water source. Figure 4 shows the association of elevation and cholera prevalence in Karonga district.

      <h5> 2.4. The role of elevation on the flow direction of microbiological contaminants of surface water source associated with pit latrine </h5>
      Figure 5 shows the results of the flow direction analysis of microbiological contaminants from temporary pit latrines in reference to elevation 
      levels. Using hydrology analysis tool for ArcGIS based on flow direction, indicates that microbiological contaminants (bacteria) from pit latrines 
      flow in eastern direction towards low lands of Karonga district. A total sum of 341378 pixels flow direction, 212979 pixels show flow direction 
      towards the surface water source of Lake Malawi, Wovwe river and Songwe river. The topography of the district has cumulative water points in the 
      high lands in which 128399 flow direction pixels converge. The spatial analysis indicates a positive significance of surface water sources 
      contamination with microbiological from pit latrines. This means the high lands of the district influences the flow direction of microbiological 
      from pit latrines to the low lands which contaminants surface water sources. <br><br>

      <h3> 3. TO DEVELOP INTERACTIVE WEB GIS MAP IN CHOLERA OUTBREAK MANAGEMENT </h3>
      The web GIS system has been developed based on open source applications will provide resourceful means for decision making in cholera outbreak 
      management. The distributed web GIS allows for any user with internet connectivity to access the mapping services on the World Wide Web. 
      The platform shows its potential in cholera information sharing to both GIS and non GIS health. The application is accessible through a generic 
      web browser at: <a href="https://maxwell0401.github.io/CholeraSpatialEpidemiology" target="_blank">https://maxwell0401.github.io/CholeraSpatialEpidemiology</a>. 
      The User Interface (UI) contains tabs such home, gap, objective, results, 
      map and downloads. On the extreme left the interface shows widgets such as zoom in, zoom out, zoom to extent and a tool for measuring distance and area. 
      The top right of the interface shows spatial layer for cholera case, water source and pit latrine. By clicking the mark symbol on the right of each layer, 
      the respective layer in the map window is removed. The interface has also cartographic elements such as legend and scale. The ‘LEGEND’ section shows the 
      symbols and colors used in the map. Figure 1 shows the user interface for the developed web GIS.
